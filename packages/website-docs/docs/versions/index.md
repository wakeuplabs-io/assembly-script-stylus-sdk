# AS-Stylus SDK Versions

The AS-Stylus SDK docs at [https://as-stylus.wakeuplabs.io/](https://https://as-stylus.wakeuplabs.io//) provide documentation for the latest version of AS-Stylus SDK.

We aim to keep the docs updated within major/minor versions, and do not publish versions for each minor or patch version. When a new major/minor is released, we archive the docs for the previous version.

You can find an archive of previous major/minor versions below.

**Latest version: v0.1.0**  
- [v0.1.0 (August 2025)](./latest.md)
